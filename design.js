<p>Jordan Walke, who is the creator of ReactJS recently announced in the micro-blogging platform, that after a decade he is leaving Facebook. Walke had been working as a software engineer at the social media giant, where he was working on the React JavaScript library.
            In a post, Walke tweeted that after spending more than a decade at the social media giant, he is finally leaving the company. However, there lies a good reason for this resignation. All these years, after working for a company, he is now going to start one of his own.
            However, the details of the company have not been disclosed yet. 
            Jordan deserves all the credit for creating React. He was influenced by XHP, a PHP-based component system that is still in use at Facebook, but also by functional programming ideas.
            Pete Hunt wanted to use React at Instagram, so he helped to extract React from Facebook-specific code. This prepared React to be open sourced.
            Later, Facebook put a team of engineers behind React and also received great contributions from the open source community. Significant contributors include Sebastian Markb√•ge and Ben Alpert, among many others.
